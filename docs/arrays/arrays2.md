## Merge 2 sorted arrays without extra space

**❓**: Given two sorted arrays arr1[] and arr2[] of sizes n and m in non-decreasing order. Merge them in sorted order. Modify arr1 so that it contains the first N elements and modify arr2 so that it contains the last M elements.<br>

## Duplicate in array of n+1 integers

**❓**: Given an array of N + 1 size, where each element is between 1 and N. Assuming there is only one duplicate number, your task is to find the duplicate number.<br>

Floyd's Cycle Detection<br>
1. Slow moves one point at a time<br>
2. Fast moves 2 points at a time.<br>
3. After they colloide, if we reset first pointer, and move that and slow pointer at a time, they will colloide at our result.<br>

## Repeating and Missing number

**❓**: You are given a read-only array of N integers with values also in the range [1, N] both inclusive. Each integer appears exactly once except A which appears twice and B which is missing. The task is to find the repeating and missing numbers A and B where A repeats twice and B is missing.<br>

**🧠**:<br>
Simple Maths Equations<br>
1. Find sum of n numbers and find X - Y value. (X- Repeating, Y - Missing)<br>
2. Find sum of squares of n numbers and form second equation. (X2 - Y2 = (X+Y)(X-Y)). From which we can get X + Y value<br>
3. From those 2 equations, X and Y can be found out<br>
