## Set Matrix Zeroes

**❓**: Given a matrix if an element in the matrix is 0 then you will have to set its entire column and row to 0 and then return the matrix.<br>
**🧠**:<br>
1. First find the indexes of rows and columns where 0 is present<br>
2. Iterate through matrix again to make relevant items to zero<br>
